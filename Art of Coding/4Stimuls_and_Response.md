Most of our real world in which we live in operates on interactions based on stimulus-response pattern.


Dictionary meaning of Stimulus  - "a thing or event that evokes a specific functional reaction in an organ or tissue".

"Response" is the answer to that stimulus.


For example, a mosquito bit you, that bite is stimulus, an external event. and your body responds to it by hitting back at the place where it bit.

The reaction time is very small(in milliseconds). In most of the cases mostly stimuli(plural of stimulus) is happening on our sense organs.

Similar pattern of interaction is seen in the programming world where a stimulus-response interactions. Now these interactions can be between a human or a software, or from one software to another software.

Stimulus-response interacting in software are very well represented by what we call as "functions".
