Most of the books, schools and universities, try to start teaching programming by writing a "Hello World",
where the computer is asked to say hello to our world on the screen.


In the prorcess we have forgotton to say hello back to the computer world.

Saying hello back to the computer world is about understanding how the world is running inside the box and the other boxes connected to it . I It also means respecting the world.


Now why we as humans need to give respect to that world.

That world is smarter than us. We are being left behind by our virtual world. 


Its high time we recognize its value and how its shaping the future.


So the jist of the whole thing is that every single characer,word you programm, you should be giving it full respect because you are presenting something to a world which is at the next level of consciousness , knowledge and operation.


Most developers think that since code can be rewritten easily by just modifying few lines of code, they just dont know the importance of writing code. Its like makinga  fool of yourself by saying something stupid and then saying sorry to undo your saying..

Computer languages are the new languages of human beings which should convey your ideas in the firsts shot itself. If you fail to do that nobody has time to come back and listen or use what you have rewritten or conveyed again. Alsways remember second chance is costlier thant the first onve.


This book is going to focus on the grammar of this new language of expression.
