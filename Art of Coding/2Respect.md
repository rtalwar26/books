Before we dive into the software world, I just want to emphasise on the fact that, we human beings should start respecting software applications as we do respect each other. If you deeply and honestly try to code and create something you will understand everything else in the world and the beautify of each and everything else.



A good application today is handling more work than an average human and also adding more value to the world.


This may sound weird, but lets for a while ,treat a software,for example,say skype, as a human or a being which is always serving you to connect you with other people far away.

If something goes wrong with skype, we start blaming the company which built it. No. Thats wrong, if skype is going down , skype the software which is living is going down. You as the programmer who built skype should feel the pain and discomfort of the software regardless of your situation, your company's situation, your package etc. Thinking it as a human being which is ill for a while and we want him to be up.


Software is a better reflection of our personalities ans we developers should start building a personal relationship with this art.

Long story short, the applications we interact with or deal with have started to behave like us. Yes they have interactions, they have goals, aspirations. They have code of conduct , instituations, societies and everything else that makes their life organized and always evolving.

So respect the Software.
